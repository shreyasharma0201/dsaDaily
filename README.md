### This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms in CPP. I will post different problems and their solutions I have encountered while practicing on various platforms. I'll also try to explain the reasoning behind the approaches from my perspective.
***
*My motive is to share this repo with my peers. Moreover, I want to maintain a list of problems that I have solved.*

###### :open_hands: *You can raise issues if you find any mistakes or have suggestions. It will be most welcome.*
