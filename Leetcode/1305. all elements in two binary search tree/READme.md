### Brute force approach 
*implemention in code1.cpp file*
#### Warning 
*This code will exceed timelimit in Leetcode. But it's good to start with brute force then move to optimized approach.*
 
> The idea is simple 
> - do dfs traversal of both BSTs 
> - store node's val in a list
> - then perform merge of both the lists.
> - finally, return final list with merrged sorted array.
